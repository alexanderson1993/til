# `package.json`

It can be tough to know all of the ins and outs of a particular thing. `package.json` is one of those nebulous things. Knowing a little can get you far, but knowing a lot can be even more powerful.

Things I learned from this article:

* Description fields are search engine indexed.
* Name is particularly useful when you namespace multi-package projects, a la `babel-plugin-` and `webpack-loader-`
