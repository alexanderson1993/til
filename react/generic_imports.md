# Generic Imports

One of the reasons I love Twitter is that you can give and get suggestions and advice really easily. case in point:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
I cringe a little bit when I see this pattern ðŸ˜¬<br>Generic imports make it harder to prune unused things. ![Code Block](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6g5S7RUwAA_PvM.jpg)

I followed up by asking how one does it any differently and then this fellow kindly helped me out:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/ralex1993">@ralex1993</a> 
<a href="https://twitter.com/_developit">@_developit</a> ![Code block 2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6kOBWWWcAEm2Ku.jpg)</p>&mdash; Emil Tholin (@Tholle1234) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tholle1234/status/840218293172621312">March 10, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As it turns out, you can let Babel know that it needs to transpile JSX with those simple declarations. Super helpful, and I'm sure it will help save my bundles from getting too big from generic imports. Handy!
